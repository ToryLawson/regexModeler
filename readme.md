# Regex Modeler

When it's finally done, this will allow a user to input a regular expression, and get back one or more strings that would satisfy that expression. For now, all it does is fail unit tests and be aggravating. I keep breaking it by flip-flopping on whether it should parse the input backwards or forwards; right now it's doing it forwards, but most of the integration tests are failing because I only recently switched it to that and I haven't fixed everything yet.

## Installation

This does not work, but if it did you would compile it and grab the binary. There is no installation per se.

## Usage

Right now it runs as a console application. It just waits for you to feed it a regex and then replies with a string.

## Contributing

It's pretty fun working on this&mdash;if you want to have fun too, by all means let me know.
